##### Problem Statement 
Bike sharing systems have become a popular mode of transportation in many cities, providing a low-cost and 
environmentally-friendly option for commuters. However,bike sharing companies face the challenge of predicting
the demand for bikes at different times and locations, in order to optimize their inventory and ensure that bikes are
available when and where they are needed. The problem statement is to develop a model that accurately predicts the demand for bikes based on
historical data on factors such as time, weather, and location. This model will help bike sharing companies to make data-driven decisions about inventory management and pricing, and ultimately improve the user experience for riders.

##### Objective
The goal of predicting bike sharing demand is to accurately forecast the number of bikes that will be rented
out at different times and locations, based on historical data and other relevant factors. This will help bike sharing
companies to optimize their inventory and pricing strategies, and ensure that bikes are available when and
where they are needed. Ultimately, the goal is to improve the user experience for riders by providing a reliable and
convenient mode of transportation that meets their needs.
